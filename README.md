# Hands-on-2021

Build a model and an interface to classify traffic signs (GTSRB dataset). This repository contains a notebook with pretrained models (neural network and SVM) fior image classification.
There is also a user interface built on dash.

## Install

* clone this repository 
* download images with `scripts/download_images.sh`

## Additional comments

About the SVM models, we trained 3 models, but only one (the most efficient, SVM-linear) of them will be stored in the model folder as the others are too big to fit in the Github repository.
